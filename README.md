# DrunkWalker
This is one of my lab assignments for my CSC330 class. It is particularly interesting because I had to leverage from various collections in order to accomplish the task of modeling random or "drunken" behavior.
I was given the skeleton of four different .java files and tasked with adding the needed functionality to each file while implementing the best practices.
